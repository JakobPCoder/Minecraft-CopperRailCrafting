# About
This Mod was made by me with the intention of making copper more useful and also making it easier to build large rail systems in survival mode.
- You can now craft 3 types of rails with Copper Ingots instead of Iron Ingots, but you will only get half as many rails per recipe.
####
    - Rail
    - Activator Rail
    - Detector Rail
